This mod demonstrates changing the base colour of all bots from white to gold by changing a section in the main material texture. The ramp texture's end brightness is also tweaked to give it a shininess.

You can find the vanilla assets and more information on editing these textures on the wiki: http://codebyfire.com/colonists/wiki/index.php/ModUnits
